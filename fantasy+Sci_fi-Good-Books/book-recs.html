                <li>The wheel of time series is also in your typical medieval fantasy setting. This book has nurmous characters it follows, and although it can difficult to keep track of them all sometimes, it is worth it. It's story revolves around fighting the "Dark One", who is an evil creature, and those who serve him. I loved reading all 14 of these books, so they will definitely keep you occupied for a while</li>
